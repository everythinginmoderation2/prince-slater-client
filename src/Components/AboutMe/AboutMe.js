                <p className="about">Since my journey as a singer-songwriter and solo performer
                began in 2016, much of my experience took place in Vietnam's cafes, restaurants, beach bars,
                parties and popular venues. I started off at open mic nights, then continued at exclusive 
                gatherings and even organized events like festivals. Book now or contact for inquiries.</p>
                <p className="about">My experience in the entertainment industry extends further
                than any guitar or mic cable. A lot of extra-curricular dedication has allowed me to take part in  
                productions on stage and in front of (or behind) cameras. Whether it be as a model, thespian, musician, emcee,
                writer, producer, or director, I have been granted such memorable opportunities to meet and work alongside other people.
                The fun continues! If you read this and consider this as a good time to reach out, please don't hesitate!</p>
